# Contributing

You are invited to contribute to this repository! You can do so by opening an issue, or by directly contributing questions.

To directly contribute a quiz question, do the following:

- Fork the repository fork_and_knife
- Add a new folder under `content/questions/`. This folder name will become the questions route in the application (for example, a folder named `foo-bar` will be accessible at https://quiz.typeofnan.dev/foo-bar)
- Add an `index.md` file in the new folder.
- Follow the patterns used in other questions in content/questions
- If you have any questions, let me know in the issues section or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nas5w)

As you contribute, please keep the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in mind and treat your fellow contributors with care and empathy!

Thank you!
